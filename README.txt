Fake News Detector is a machine learning project that classifies news articles as real or fake using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It uses publicly available datasets (like the Kaggle Fake and Real News Dataset) and applies standard text preprocessing steps such as lowercasing, stopword removal, and lemmatization. The cleaned text is transformed using TF-IDF vectorization and fed into various classifiers including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost, achieving up to 93% accuracy. The project supports both command-line usage and a web interface built with Flask, where users can input news content and receive real-time classification results.

To run the project, clone the repository, install the required packages from requirements.txt, and execute the model training script (train_model.py). You can also launch the web app by running app.py, then access it via your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000. This tool is useful for raising awareness around misinformation and can be further improved by integrating deep learning models like BERT, expanding language support, and deploying it to platforms like Heroku or AWS for broader access.
